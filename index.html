        <p>CULPA, a website for Columbia students to rate their professors, displays information in an unintuitive way
          that lacks usability and accessibility.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Low Usability:</strong> Students are the primary users. They visit the website to gain insights into
            the professor's teaching style and class workload. However, the design makes students hard to get insights
            effectively. Reviews are ranked in chronological order without regard to the length of reviews or the class
            they are coming from.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Low Learnability:</strong> It is difficult for users to write or understand the implication the
            first time they encounter this interface. To write a review, you need to click either of the two dropdown
            buttons. Moreover, under the professor's name, sometimes there is a line, "This professor has earned a CULPA
            gold nugget." However, you must go to the dropdown on the top right, click FAQ, and then know what "gold
            nugget" means.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Low Memorability:</strong> Even if a user has tried multiple times, it is still hard for them to
            remember how to
            use it. Through interviews with Columbia students, I found little people could tell me the difference
            between the two dropdown button on the top right.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
          <p>Accessibility</p>
        </div>
        <p>I found the result useful and insightful. It reveals much information that is indiscernible for regular users
          but troublesome for people using screen readers. For example, the two dropdown buttons on the top right have
          the same ARIA label, “dropdown menu button,” so people with screen readers can only distinguish one from the
          other by reading what's included in the list, which is time-consuming. However, some other alerts seem to be
          false positives. One common alert on the page is “redundant link.” But that is necessary because each review
          needs to indicate what class it is referring to, which helps students navigate between classes.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>I enable users to filter and sort reviews. Students could either filter by class name or time range.
              They could also sort by time or review length. This feature enables users to find the most useful review
              for them more effectively, thus increasing usability.</li>
            <li>Without going to FAQ to find the meaning of the golden badge, users could click the information icon on
              the top right. It reduces the things to learn and remember for users, thus improving learnability and
              memorability.</li>
            <li>I break down the two drop-down menus into three core functions: FAQ, Contact, and Write A Review. So
              people no longer need to memorize what's included in each dropdown menu, thus improving memorability.
            </li>
            <li>We summarize and list common phrases that appear in reviews, so students can quickly click the tag and
              get all reviews that contain the term, such as "Midterm." This feature boosts usability by improving
              users' task success effectiveness.</li>

            <p>High-Fidelity Prototyping</p>
          </div>

          <p>Design Notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To make it responsive for laptop, tablet, and phone screens, I use "flex" as display and "column" as
              flex-direction. Thus, as the width decreases from the laptop screen, the component "Read reviews that
              mention" would automatically be arranged between the professor's name and the following reviews.</li>
            <li> Many parts of the page would change due to user actions.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The color of tags in "Read reviews that mention" will turn darker as the user hovers over them. This
                  is made possible by "ul li:hover" block in CSS, where I specify a different background color from the
                  standard "ul li."
                </li>
                <li>When a user clicks the blue information icon on the top right of the yellow badge, a pop-up will
                  appear describing the meaning of the badge. This is made possible by a JS function "handleMessage" in
                  HTML. The message will automatically disappear after a while because I set a timeout of 3000.
                </li>
                <li>When a user clicks the "filter" or "sort" button on the page, they can expand to see the filtering
                  and sorting options. This is made possible by a JS script that creates a block of options to appear on
                  click.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
